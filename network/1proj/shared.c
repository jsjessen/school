// examples of major sections of code include handling the command line parameters; establishing the listening socket in the server; handling the input for the initial contact from the client; handling the interaction for the password interaction from the client.

 // You should also avoid repeating very similar pieces of code â€“ instead move what would be repeated into functions with appropriate parameters. For example, there should be a function that reads a string that is prefixed by a length;there should be a function that reads a newline-terminated string; etc.
 
// Check return value of all syscalls
// print appropriate msg
// exit if error occurs

// remember that send and recv on TCP sockets do not necessarily send and receive as much data as was requested to be sent/received

// Make sure that buffers are big enough for the values that may be stored in them.

// use memcpy instead of strcpy

// send only neccesary char, not entire buf

// To go from a hostname or an IP address expressed in dotted decimal notation as a string to a value suitable for storing in a struct sockaddr_in for use in a call to connect you use the library function getaddrinfo()
