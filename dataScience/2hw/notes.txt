Load data
data1 <- read.csv(file = "nyt1.csv")

create var age_group and categorize ages: <18, 18–24, 25–40, 41–64, and 65+


 For a single day:
	• Plot the distributions of the number of impressions and click-through-
	rate (CTR = Nr. clicks/Nr. impressions) for these five age categories.
	• Define a new variable to categorize (segment) users based on their
	click behavior.
	• Explore the data and make visual and quantitative comparisons across
	user segments/demographics. In particular, compare under 18-year-
	old males versus under-18-year-old females, and 18 to 24 year old
	females versus 25 to 40 year old females.
	• Create metrics/measurements/statistics that summarize the data.
	Metrics you should include are CTR, quantiles, mean, median, vari-
	ance and max, and these should be calculated across the various user
	segments. Think about what will be important to track over time—
	what will compress the data, but still capture user behavior.
