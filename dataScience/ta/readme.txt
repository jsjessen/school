Acknowledgments are due to Coursera for what I learned from the R Programming
course taught by Roger D. Peng and for his book, R Programming for Data
Science available at http://leanpub.com/rprogramming.

Acknowledgments are also due to Google Developers for their YouTube
lectures on R (first one at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iffR3fWv4xw) from which I gleaned much
of the material for these tutorials.

As mentioned in the Session 3 tutorial, the graphing information is
from http://www.statmethods.net/graphs/ which is a great resource, and
then there are numerous other places I googled to find answers to
questions I've had.

Thanks also to Peng Lin who told me about ggplot2!

P.S.  I found the data on the web at mysafeinfo.com except for
climate_data.csv which is actually just the airquality dataset available in
the R datasets package.
